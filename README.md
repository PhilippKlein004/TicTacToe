# TicTacToe
This program allows you to play TicTacToe against a computer with three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal and Hard. The user interface is made using JFrames. To learn more about how the program works, how to use it and what limitations it has please look inside the linked PDF. If you want to know everything about this program, I've made a PDF, that I've uploaded to my website (https://kleinworkspace.com).
